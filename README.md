# MonkeyCode - A typing test CLI program but you get to code 🧑🏻‍💻|>_|

MonkeyCode is a terminal-based typing test tool for developers, where users practice typing by writing actual code in their favorite programming languages. Choose from languages like Go, C/C++, Python, Java, and JavaScript, and challenge yourself with real coding tasks while tracking your Words Per Minute (WPM) and accuracy. 

The project also includes an SSH server directory, allowing users to connect and use the app remotely over SSH.

## Why?

Typing speed test apps such as monkeytype, typingspeedtest, 10fastfinger, etc. are often limited to plain text, missing the unique challenges of coding syntax. MonkeyCode fills this gap by providing a typing test designed specifically for developers, with realistic code snippets that help improve typing speed and accuracy in real-world coding scenarios.

With the included SSH server setup, MonkeyCode enables a collaborative and shared experience, making it ideal for coding bootcamps, hackathons, and remote practice.
